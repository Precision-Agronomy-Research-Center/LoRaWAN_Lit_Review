# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Values

This project aims to provide a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment for contributors working on the systematic review **“LoRaWAN for Agriculture Decision Support.”**

The success of this project depends on the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including researchers, engineers, agronomists, extension specialists, farmers, data scientists, policymakers, and open-source practitioners. We believe that high-quality synthesis of technical and applied knowledge emerges when contributors are able to engage openly, critically, and constructively. We are committed to fostering a community where participants feel supported in sharing evidence, experiences, and perspectives, including lessons learned from real-world deployments. Inclusivity and professionalism are foundational to the integrity and impact of this review.
